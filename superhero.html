<p>Fictional character biography

The spider bite that gave Peter Parker his powers. Amazing Fantasy #15, art by Steve Ditko.
From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people. Fittingly, then, 
his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people. In 1968, in the wake of actual militant student demonstrations at
 Columbia University, Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University.... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy 
 for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds himself caught between militant leftism 
 and angry conservatives.

Powers, skills, and equipment
A bite from a radioactive spider triggers mutations in Peter Parker's body, granting him superpowers. 
In the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has the ability to cling to walls (based on distance-dependent interaction between his body and the surfaces known 
as the Van der Waals force), superhuman strength, a sixth sense ("spider-sense") that alerts him to danger, perfect balance and equilibrium, as well as 
superhuman speed and agility. The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, but later writers have depicted his 
intellect at genius level. Academically brilliant, Parker has expertise in the fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, 
and mechanics. 
With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters to help navigate and trap his enemies along with a spider-signal as a flashlight and a warning beacon to criminals.</p>
